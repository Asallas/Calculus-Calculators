A simple derivative calculator that will calculate full derivatives. Partial differentiation is not yet supported.
List of supported functions:
- Polynomial
- Trigonometric(standard, inverse trig, and hyperbolic)
- Logarithms
- Exponential
- Absolute value
Stil needs to be updated to support simplification and eventually integration
